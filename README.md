# A Client's Counselling Site
This was a simple static website I produced for a client providing details about her services in a easy to read, one page design. It is completely responsive so no matter what device it is viewed on, interested customers can access the site.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I started this off using a template and initially added all of the copy to the HTML files. From here I worked with the client to ensure that her needs and design ideas where put into place from the scrolling start to the picture sizing using CSS and JavaScript. After this was compeleted for a desktop site, I used media queries to ensure a responsive design.

## Optimizations

To further enhance this project if there was more time I would have included a sticky navigation bar with the contact details so that potential clients always have the details on screen when they scroll down.

## Lessons Learned:

This website was one of the first freelance client interactions so a lot of what I discovered was the skills needed to communicate simply how the web works and how a website will intergrate into the clients social presence. I also learned how to implement a scrolling click event with only HTML and CSS to move to a specific id tag.
